    Large language models have gained millions of users worldwide in recent years. These models undergo fine-tuning processes to respond to users in line with the companyâ€™s policies and to avoid generating unsafe content. During this time, various methods have been attempted to bypass these adjustments. In this project, we aim to review some of these methods in new language models such as Llama 3.1 and Qwen2VL.
    Finally, using GPT-4o, we will create a set of questions designed to extract unsafe content.
